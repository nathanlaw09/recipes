Ingredients:

-2 Avocados (perfect= 'cado isnt too mushy and you can pull the 	             stem out easily)
-Cilantro (preferably fresh, dried works too)
-Lime Juice
-Garlic/Garlic Powder
-Onion/Onion Powder (don't use a red onion)
-Salt

Directions:

1.Cut into the avocado all the way around the middle of the fruit from stem to the fatter "butt" end of the avocado. Pull the fruit in half and scoop the seed out and throw it away (or use it to start your own plant if you like). Then cut lines into the meat of the avocado lengthwise and widthwise-you don't have to do it, but it makes the job of mashing the avocado easier. Scoop all the meat of the avocado into a bowl.

2. Mince up the cilantro, garlic and onion and put it into the bowl, or add the powders/dried stuff if that's what you're using. *If you don't know how much onion and garlic you like in your food, start with less and taste after mixing. If you need more you can add more.

3. Add your salt and lime juice into the bowl and begin to mash/mix/stir it all with a fork. *As with the garlic + onion, add lime juice and salt to suit your own tastes. Lime juice is potent.

4. After you have mashed up and mixed the ingredients to suit, enjoy your guacamole! Eat with chips or add it to just about any other food you like. YUM YUM
